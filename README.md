# BruceSafe
A JavaScript game made to be played on Bruce firmware, specifically for the LILYGO T-Embed devkit.


## Installation

The steps to play BruceSafe are quite easy.
- If you have an SD card, plug it in your computer, transfer BruceSafe.js in it, plug the SD card back on your T-Embed and start the script from "JS Interpreter" or "Files".
- If you don't have an SD card, you can use the LittleFS storage. To do that, go to "Files" > "WebUI" > "My Network" > Choose your network and type its password > Visit the IP Address displayed by the T-Embed on your PC > Press "Upload File" and upload the script. Then you can start the script either from "JS Interpreter" or "Files".
